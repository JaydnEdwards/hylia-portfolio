# Hi, I'm Jaydn.

I’m a Junior Web Designer & Front-End Developer, based in Pontefract, West Yorkshire. I have been taught and taught myself web over the past 3 years at Wakefield College and the University Centre at Wakefield College. I've studied HTML, CSS, SCSS, WordPress theme creation, branding and digital marketing.

In addition, I am a volunteer at [Pontefract Castle](https://www.pontefractcastle.co.uk/) and am a member of and volunteer at the [Pontefract Civic Society](https://www.pontefractcivicsociety.org.uk/).

While I’m interested in technology as a web designer, gamer and digital media addict, I also have a passion for ancient history and mythology. I will bore you about ancient Mesopotamia, given the chance. I can also make a pretty decent planet or moon, if I do say so myself.

## I'm a designer.

I’ve worked in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign, and have tried Sketch and Figma. I have created web designs, designs for print, logo and branding designs and branded documents. In my portfolio, you'll see some professional examples, as well as university work.

## Get in touch!

I am currently searching for full-time work. I am also considering small freelance gigs.

If you are recruiting, or have an enquiry about anything, please do not hesitate to get in touch.
