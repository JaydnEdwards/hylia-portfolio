# Hi, I'm Jaydn.

I’m a Junior Web Designer & Front-End Developer, based in Pontefract, West Yorkshire. I have been taught and taught myself web over the past 3 years at Wakefield College and the University Centre at Wakefield College. I've studied HTML, CSS, SCSS, WordPress theme creation, branding and digital marketing.

In addition, I am a volunteer at Pontefract Castle and am a member of the Pontefract Civic Society.

While I’m interested in technology as a web designer, gamer and digital media addict, I also have a passion for ancient history and mythology. I will bore you about ancient Mesopotamia, given the chance.

## I'm a designer. Here's some of my work.

I’ve worked in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign, and have tried Sketch and Figma. I have created web designs, designs for print, logo and branding designs and branded documents.



Here are a few examples of actual client work. However, Tracey Atkinson is not live on its own domain right now. You can see a live version on my own domain.
