Alisha Faye is a very close and dear friend of mine; we went through our GCSE's together. So, when I had an Agency module at university, she was the first in line for a custom portfolio. 

She is a digital artist and animator, who was studying her first year at university in Leeds when I created this. She's got a fanbase of around 1000 followers on Twitter and Instagram each, and really needed her own place to curate and host her artwork. 

What she needed was a content management system that would easily allow her to do just that: WordPress. I built her a custom, responsive WordPress theme and wrote the copy for her. 

This was a perfect chance for me to learn theme creation, and I think I did a pretty decent job of it.
