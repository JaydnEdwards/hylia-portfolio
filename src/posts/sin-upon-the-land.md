Ashur cut through flesh and muscle of the Great Ziggurat's defenders. They were nigh unending, coming from stair and sky. But, end they did. The defenders were exhausted in the streets and stairs, and dead within the palace. Blood ran down the thousands of stairs like a river of wine. The brick was slick, making the climb treacherous enough without blade in hand.

One more step, and Ashur reached the throne room at the peak of the Great Ziggurat with wings outstretched. His face, smeared and covered in blood the same hue as his crown of scales. At his right stood Beorhtsige. At the Throne, stood the King. 

"_How dare you!_ You invade this sacred place with your band of traitorous scum, and point your blade at _me_?!" The King's hoarse, deep voice carried throughout the throne room while his face contorted in disgust and contempt. He took a heavy step, drawing his sword clumsily from its scabbard. 

Ashur growled in response, growing to a snarling scream of pure, unadulterated rage.

"You are a grotesque monster. A poor ruler who cares naught but his own reign, even as the world around us burns and the land dies. The world has seen enough and your kingdom has suffered under your yoke. It ends. One way or another, it ends tonight." He raised his sword, and a Fist of Dryuk Myrmidons rushed from the stairs behind Ashur. They marched well into the throne room, creating a perimeter. They held their blades ready, prepared to attack.

A whistle through the air, and a blood curdling scream. 

From the King's breast, a knife.

"NO! No..no...no...no... KILL THEM!"

The Myrmidons took one step, and another, slowly creating a smaller circle. They ignored Ashur and Beorhtsige.

"What are you doing? Wait- No! Get away!"

Ashur and Beorhtsige walked by, passing the slaughter of the King by those he once commanded and yet saw as nothing but disposable pawns. He walked to the throne, attempting to block out the sword of metal rending flesh, even after the screams and whimpers had stopped.

"This is the Throne..." Beorhtsige stood in awe of the crystal throne that towered above him. 

"Yes, and with it you will be able to command the reserves of Essence my kingdom has collected over centuries. I pray that this will be enough to save you, my friend." Ashur's voice became taut.

"No need for prayer. This will work, or it won't. Either way, I'll blast that crazed bitch and her army into dust."

"I will watch over you. I'll always be here for you."

Beorhtsige nodded solemnly, stood upon on a circle of azure before the throne, and began to pray.

"The light of the moon illuminates me." _Knock._ "It cleanses my soul," _Draw._ "And brings Sin upon the land." _LOOSE!_
